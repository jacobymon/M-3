This folder was made so that isolated testing could be done on the universal queue and song class without integration from the spotify
interface class.

to run simply do: python test_IsoUniversalQueue.py

It also has updated flags in the song initializer function in order to test Write() and recover(). Note that these methods are not yet
integrated with other components yet!
