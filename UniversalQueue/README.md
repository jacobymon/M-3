the file test_UniQueue runs a series of 3 hard coded shorts songs (don't be freaked out when they play) and will have to verified manually that they songs play.
in order to do this, you will need a spotify premium account and have an instance of it running.
Due to the start up running a server, you will have to hit control c in order to start the test after
running the python file.
